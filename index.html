            Hello, my name is Johnny, and I'll tell you a little about myself. I currently live in the city of João
            Pessoa in the
            state of Paraíba. I'm married and 27 years old. I have an amazing daughter. I currently work for an airline
            called Gol
            Linhas Aéreas. I love this job, just as I love this city. My favorite places in João Pessoa are the beaches
            on the south
            coast; some of them have the meeting of the river and the sea, so sometimes I skip swimming in the sea and
            go to the
            river instead. My daughter loves the river. I've been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
            Saints for 7
            years, and during that same period, I served as a missionary in the best mission in the world, the Brazil
            Santos
            Mission.
