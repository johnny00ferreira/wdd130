        <p>
            Hello, my name is Johnny, and I'll tell you a little about myself. I currently live in the city of João
            Pessoa in the
            state of Paraíba. I'm married and 27 years old. I have an amazing daughter. I currently work for an airline
            called Gol
            Linhas Aéreas. I love this job, just as I love this city. My favorite places in João Pessoa are the beaches
            on the south
            coast; some of them have the meeting of the river and the sea, so sometimes I skip swimming in the sea and
            go to the
            river instead. My daughter loves the river. I've been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
            Saints for 7
            years, and during that same period, I served as a missionary in the best mission in the world, the Brazil
            Santos
            Mission.

        <h2>Paraiba - Brazil</h2>
        <img src="images/foto-paraiba.jpg" alt=" photo of paraiba" width="250" />
        <p>Paraíba is a charming state in the Brazilian Northeast, known for its beautiful beaches and rich cultural
            heritage. Its
            capital, João Pessoa, is one of the oldest cities in the country and famous for its sunsets on Jacaré beach.
            The state
            is also home to the easternmost point of the Americas, where the sun rises first in Brazil. Beyond its
            natural beauty,
            Paraíba stands out for its handicrafts, cuisine, and popular festivals. It's a destination that combines
            history,
            nature, and hospitality in every corner.</p>
